Feedback: Throughout the internship, I had the chance to work on a challenging and meaningful project focused on developing the backend for an E-commerce site. I appreciated the collaborative and supportive environment in the team. The regular meetings helped me to stay on track. Overall, I am immensely grateful for the knowledge and skills I have gained during this internship. It has been a transformative experience, and I feel well-prepared for future backend development projects.

Suggested Changes:
In my opinion:
1. There should be person assigned to a team, which should be interactive, ask feedbacks, mentor them in any need at regular intervals.
2. Encouraging the team to explore and experiment with new technologies and tools can lead to innovative solutions.
3. Organizing Inter-Teams meetings to show the progress with the time so that Interns can learn something from each other's project. It will be beneficial in improving the individual project growth.
